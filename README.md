Hi I'm Gabriel Apolinário and I'm a researcher in physics.
My research is in turbulence and stochastic PDEs, using analytical and numerical methods to understand
large fluctuations and rare events.

- 💻 I'm currently working with [Prof. Michael Wilczek][wilc] at the University of Bayreuth, in Germany
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Quantum Field Theory
- 💬 Ask me about random processes, movies or south-american literature
